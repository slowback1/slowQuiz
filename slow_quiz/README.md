# SlowQuiz

## What it is

SlowQuiz is a simple quiz app built with React using the OpenTDB API found at https://opentdb.com/

## How to access it

A Gist should be up within the week, I will put a link here when it is up, otherwise, to use it as I am testing it, clone the repository on the Cloud9 IDE, cd slow_quiz, npm install, npm start in that order

## To-Do
* Create functionality for sessions so that quiz stats are saved on page reload, and to help remove repeat questions
* Mobile Friendly-ify the page layout
* Make it prettier in general
* have something besides a placeholder in the about page (may just copy/paste this readme there)
* Using D3, create an updating Pie Chart to show your correct and incorrect answers, maybe split it into categories if I'm feeling up to it
* Probably more
